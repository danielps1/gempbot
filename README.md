# gempbot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gempir/gempbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gempir/gempbot)

This bot is highly experimental and constantly changing. Don't consider all pushes to github stable since I test a lot.
This is also a fun oriented bot and less of a general channel bot. This bot also highly relies on some API services I host on my own website.
So don't expect this bot to work out of the box.
