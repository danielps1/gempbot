# gempbot

This bot is highly experimental and constantly changing. Don't consider all pushes to github stable since I test a lot.
This is also a fun oriented bot and less of a general channel bot. It does stuff like counting emotes for specific users or the whole chat.
And this is one of the strengths of this bot, it has built in logging completly usable without any webserver.
It uploads logs to pastebin and you don't have to host anything yourself.
